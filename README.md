yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-examples
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth-examples
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
